    <h4>Team Experience</h4>
      <p>
        My team experience for the group presentation was both rewarding and challenging, offering valuable insights into teamwork and interdisciplinarity. 
      </p>
    <h5>
      Interdisciplinary:
    </h5>
      <p>
        Our group included members from diverse disciplines—global communications, business and commerce, biomedicine, science, and myself from engineering and commerce—which led to different approaches. While communications and commerce focused on the broader problem, science and biomedicine explored project details, and I naturally leaned toward finding solutions. This diversity enriched our discussions but required effort to align our ideas.
      </p>
    <h5> 
      Enjoy and difficulties:
    </h5>
      <p>
        I enjoyed the collaborative and supportive atmosphere as we openly discussed ideas throughout the trip. However, I found it difficult that our project direction remained unclear until the later stages, as I prefer leaving time to proofread and ensure consistency.
      </p>
    <h5> 
      Conclusion:
    </h5>
      <p>
        This experience highlighted how interdisciplinarity enhances problem-solving by combining unique perspectives. It also taught me the importance of balancing flexibility with structure in teamwork to achieve a cohesive and polished result.
