    <h4>Identify and Reframe</h4>

      <p>
        Identifying and reframing the challenge required iterative discussions and reflection, particularly given my engineering background. Initially, I focused on finding solutions, but this approach did not align with the project’s goal of analyzing systemic issues.

    <h5>
      Collaboration
    </h5>
        Collaborating with my team, I learned to consider perspectives beyond technical fixes, such as cultural and ecological factors. Consulting local experts like Dr. Jo Leen clarified the broader context of biodiversity and urbanisation, leading to a reframed challenge highlighting the government’s failure to prioritize green space preservation. 
        <br>
        This process taught me to integrate interdisciplinary insights, improving my ability to approach challenges beyond engineering constraints.
