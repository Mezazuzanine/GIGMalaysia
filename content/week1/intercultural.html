        Understanding the Semai people's cosmology offers profound insights into their worldview and their relationship with the environment. Central to their belief system is the concept of "Ruai," or souls, which extends beyond humans to encompass elements of their natural surroundings, such as "Ruai Bak" (the soul of rice). This interconnectedness underscores their respect for nature as a living, spiritual entity.

        The deity Junang, considered the most powerful in their cosmology, plays a pivotal role in guiding their way of life, particularly through agricultural practices and rituals. For the Semai, the forest is not merely a resource, but a shared space inhabited by spirits and unseen beings who coexist with humans. This belief shapes their sustainable interaction with the environment, ensuring its preservation for future generations. 
        <br>
        By integrating spirituality with ecological stewardship, the Semai cosmology exemplifies a harmonious relationship between humans and the natural world, offering lessons for global sustainability.
