    <h4>Challenge Identification</h4>
      <h5>Description: </h5>
      <p>
        In the first week of the trip, our group decided to focus on heritage protection and urbanisation as the central themes for our project. This decision stemmed from Assignment Three discussions, where two members explored heritage, while three others focused on rural and urban development. Our visit to Bukit Kiara further reinforced the initial idea to investigate the effects of climate change on heritage sites.
      </p>
        <h5>Feelings: </h5>
      <p>
          Initially, we felt confident in our chosen topic, believing there was sufficient time to refine it and explore additional sites before finalising the assignment. However, as the week progressed, uncertainty grew due to a lack of initiative and clear direction.
      </p>
        <h5>Evaluation: </h5>
      <p>
        While our discussions were productive, our approach lacked focus. The turning point came during a workshop with our academic, Framjee, who suggested that climate change was overly specific and recommended shifting towards biodiversity and urbanisation.
      </p>
        <h5>Conclusion: </h5>
      <p>
        This reframing provided much-needed clarity and paved the way for our refined problem statement, which ultimately aligned better with the projectâ€™s scope and objectives.
