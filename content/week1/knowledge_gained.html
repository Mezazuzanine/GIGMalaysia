    <h4>Knowledge Gained</h4>
      <p>
        Before departure, I had read Malaysia Economic Monitor by the World Bank, giving me an understanding that Malaysia's economy is a diverse mix of manufacturing, services, and agriculture, with palm oil being a major contributor to its GDP and exports. During the trip, by further research, I found out that Malaysia was the second biggest country for palm oil exports.ยน Having just completed a unit in economics, the difference between the Malaysian economy and Australian Economy really intrigued me.
