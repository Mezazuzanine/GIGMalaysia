    <h4>Intercultural Experience</h4>
      <p>
        While exploring various night markets and restaurants in Malaysia, I noticed that prices were significantly cheaper than in Australia. For instance, meals at hawker stalls often cost less than 10RM, which is a fraction of the price of equivalent meals in Australia. Despite knowing that the minimum wage in Malaysia is only 7.21RM per hour,¹ 
        <br>
        I was still surprised by how low the costs were, reflecting the disparity in purchasing power and labor costs between the two countries. This difference is largely driven by Malaysia’s lower cost of living and its reliance on industries like manufacturing and agriculture, which depend on affordable labor.
        <br><br>
        From a Commerce Major’s perspective, I found it particularly interesting how these low costs impact Malaysia’s competitiveness in the global market. 
        <br>
        However, while low wages make Malaysia attractive for investors, it raises concerns about income inequality and quality of life. ² Compared to Australia, where higher wages and living standards are supported by robust social welfare systems, Malaysia’s lower wages highlight the challenges of balancing economic growth with equitable development.
