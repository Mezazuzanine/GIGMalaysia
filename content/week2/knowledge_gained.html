      Chinese in Malaysia
    </h5>  
      <p>
        Especially in Penang, I experienced firsthand the significant presence of the Chinese population in Malaysia. Many stores and restaurants had Cantonese-speaking staff, reflecting the cultural accommodation for the 23% of Malaysia's population that is Chinese.¹ This resonated deeply with me, as I am Chinese, allowing me to learn about the area's history while hearing the stories and journeys of others who share my heritage.

     <h5>
      Ecotourism
     </h5> 
      <p>  
        Another notable observation was the potential of ecotourism and its role in biodiversity preservation. For example, Project Stampede, a collaboration between the Orang Asli and WWF, has successfully reduced tiger poaching by an impressive 98%, showcasing the impact of community-led conservation efforts.²
